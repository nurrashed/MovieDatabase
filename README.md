## Project Name: Movie Search APP

## Project Description: 

I developed a SPA (Single Page Application) with React Js, which allows the users to search for movies.  

The application includes the following features: 
- User can see all trendy movies. This trendy movie page is the home page of this app.
- Movie page where user can see all the movies. In this page user can also sort movies according to genre. User also can select multiple genres at the same time.  
- The user can be able to search for movies by any text. 
- User can select the movie name from the list, which will load information in the right panel. 
- An overview of the movie will be shown in the Overview panel and, a list of similar movies will be shown in the Similar movies panel.  
- User can see the background color change of the movie he/she upon movie selected from the left panel list. 
- User can see the current page number and total page number in the bottom of the page  
- All the pages have Pagination facility. 
- App has routing facility.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start" : "react-scripts start"`,

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `"npm run build": "react-scripts build"`,

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app will be ready to deploy!

### `"npm run test": "react-scripts test"`,

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.

### `"serve": "node server"`

For running the server file on you can use this command.

### `npm run serve`
