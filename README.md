## Project Name: Movie Search APP

## Project Description: 

I developed a SPA (Single Page Application) with React Js, which allows the users to search for movies.  

The application includes the following features: 
- User can see all trendy movies. This trendy movie page is the home page of this app.
- Movie page where user can see all the movies. In this page user can also sort movies according to genre. User also can select multiple genres at the same time.  
- The user can be able to search for movies by any text. 
- User can select the movie name from the list, which will load information in the right panel. 
- An overview of the movie will be shown in the Overview panel and, a list of similar movies will be shown in the Similar movies panel.  
- User can see the background color change of the movie upon selecting it from left side panel. 
- User can see the current page number and total page number in the bottom of the page  
- All the pages have Pagination facility. 
- App has routing facility. 
- App is full responsive

### `npm start" : "react-scripts start"`,

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## This app is Built With

- JavaScript(React)
- HTML
- CSS

## Limitations and Future Plan

- Will try to implement this app using TypeScript. Could not do this due to limited time. 
- Right now user can see the background color change of the movie upon selecting it from left side panel. But it disappear immediately. I will try to make the background fixed until user select next movie from the list.
